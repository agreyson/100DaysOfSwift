//use switch statement to print out items that must be packed for a trip (use your imagination to pick items, and make sure there are at least 2 items for each trip. these items must be printed on different lines - hint: use multi line strings!). There are four types of trips: beach, snow, forest, & city. The beach is near a city, so beach trips must include city items as well (hint: use a fallthrough). In case of a lame trip that is not one of these types, return ":("
func packing(trip: String){
    //fill in
}

//write a print statement for each case
