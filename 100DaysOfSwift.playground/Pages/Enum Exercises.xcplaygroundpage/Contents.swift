// Day 2.10: Enum raw values (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/sixty/2/10/enum-raw-values)
//
// Design an enum GradeLevel that represents the seven grade levels at Castilleja,
// sixth through senior.
// Then write a one line function graduationYear that takes a GradeLevel value
// as a parameter, and returns the graduation year for that grade level.

func graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel) -> Int {
    return 0 // Replace this line.
}

print("Seniors graduate in \(graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel.senior)).")
print("Sixth graders graduate in \(graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel.sixth)).")
print("Eighth graders graduate in \(graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel.eighth)).")
print("Juniors graduate in \(graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel.junior)).")
print("Seventh graders graduate in \(graduationYear(gradeLevel: GradeLevel.seventh)).")
