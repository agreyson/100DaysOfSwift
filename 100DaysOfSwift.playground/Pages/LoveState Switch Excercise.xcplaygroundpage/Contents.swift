//relationship status
// design a switch statement for love status that takes in 4 cases: looking for love, single by choice, healthy relationship, and toxic relationship. With each case, create a let statement called loveState and assign it to one of the cases. Once you do this, make a print statement for each of the cases and print a message specialized for each case. When you run it, the message for the specific case of the loveState should show. The message for looking for love should be "desperate af", for single by choice: "#free", for healthy relationship: "going steady", and for toxic relationship: "drowning in the fumes of your lies". Make the default case "I'm kinda just existing".
